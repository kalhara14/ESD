This file is regarding my ESD assessment 3.
  
1. How to commit in git - once you are ready to commit add a meaning full description of changes you have done and commit.

2. how to create a branch - when commiting click on "create a new branch" give your branch a name and commit changes.

3.how to merge to master branch - when you are ready to merge start a new pull request. After that if there are no merge conflicts you can merge two branches otherwise you have to manully resolve conflicts and then merge two branches.

Note that all above instructions using web interface, in CLI steps can be different.

Thank you.
